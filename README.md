# Ecosystem
February - March 2016

### About:
A visual simulation of the Ecosystem:
- Organisms include worms, leeches, mosquitoes.
- Animals include frogs, fish.

Organisms are the food source for Animals. They don't eat, mate or die.

Animals only eat organisms to survive, and reproduce if they're healthy.
Animals will die if run out of food and eventually the organisms will takeover the Ecosystem.

Animals show signs of hunger by changing their body colour:
 - Hungry = green
 - Dying = red
 - Dead = disappear
