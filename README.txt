C++ Term 2 Mini Project: Ecosystem
by Uyen Le

Git repo: https://github.com/uyenle57/cppUyen2


This is a visual simulation of the Ecosystem.
Organisms are: worms, leeches, mosquitoes.
Animals are: frogs, fish.

TO USE:
- Add new Organisms to feed the Animals (keypress)
- If no food (Organisms) are added, Animals will die and eventually Organisms will takeover the Ecosystem.

Organisms are the food source for Animals. They don't eat, mate or die. New organisms can be created by the user pressing keys:
- 'w' to add new Worms
- 'l' to add new Leeches
- 'm' to add new Mosquitoes

Animals don't eat each other, only eat Organisms to survive. They also reproduce if they're healthy.
Animals die if run out of food.
Animals show signs of hunger by changing their body colour:
 - Hungry = green
 - Dying = red
 - Dead = disappear
