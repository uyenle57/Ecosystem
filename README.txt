C++ Term 2 Mini Project: Ecosystem
by Uyen Le

This is a visual simulation of the Ecosystem.

- Add new Organisms to feed the Animals (keypress)
- If no new Organisms are added, Animals will die and eventually Organisms will takeover the Ecosystem.

Organisms are: worms, leeches, mosquitoes.
Animals are: frogs, big fish, flock of small fish.

Organisms are the food source for Animals. They don't eat, mate or die.
Animals don't eat each other, only eat Organisms to survive. Die when run out of food.
Animals show signs of hunger by changing their body colour:
 - Hungry = green
 - Dying = red
 - Dead = fade away
